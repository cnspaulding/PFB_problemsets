Caitlin by Shel Silverstein

Caitlin loves me,
Caitlin cares,
Caitlin picks me peaches and pears.
Caitlin offers me candy and Cokes,
Caitlin listens and laughs at me jokes.
Caitlin helps when I get in a fight,
Caitlin does all my homework at night.
Caitlin misses me,
Caitlin cries,
Caitlin thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Caitlin is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Caitlin just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Caitlin's hand,
In the darkness where Caitlin usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Caitlin's gone!
